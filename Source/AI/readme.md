## Features:

- Training Model: Train your own custom image classifier using a pre-trained MobileNet model.
  
- Data Preparation: Prepare Pokémon images for training by cleaning, organizing, and augmenting the dataset.
  
- Image Classification: Use the trained model to classify Pokémon images into different species with high accuracy.

- Easy-to-Use: Simple and intuitive interface for training and using the image classifier.

## Usage:

- `prep-data.mjs`: Prepares Pokémon images for training by cleaning, organizing, and augmenting the dataset.

- `training.mjs`: Trains the image classifier using the prepared dataset.

- `model.mjs`: Loads the trained model and classifies Pokémon images.

## Getting Started:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone `https://github.com/Team-BANERUS/poketwo-Autocatcher.git`.
- Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies using npm install.
- Prepare Data: Use prep-data.mjs to prepare Pokémon images for training. Make sure to organize the images according to Pokémon species.
- Train Model: Run training.mjs to train the image classifier using the prepared dataset.
Use the Model: Use model.mjs to load the trained model and classify Pokémon images.
